prompt 1: You are a physician.  Please list as a semicolon separated list the most 
          important problems/diagnoses based on the progress note text below.  Only list
          the problems/diagnoses and nothing else.  Be concise. 

prompt 2: Think about the problem more, can you refine this list to the most important
          problems/diagnoses? 


Flow: 

Initial prompt: Could refine this more, but for now using the ProbSumm prompt that was 
                found to lead to best results in other tests.

Self-Reflect and refine: Think about the problem more, and refine the list of diagnoses.  


Different from the coding problem because we don't have test cases. 


Qodo:

Initial prompt, self-reflection, test sutie, test-based iteration, refine and repeat.

This iterative process allows the LLM to learn from its mistakes and gradually converge 
on a correct solution.  It empowers the LLM to be more flexible and adaptable in its 
code generation. 

Dodo: 

Start with: initial prompt, self-reflect and refine.  

Not all of the steps relevant to solving coding challenges are relevant to the probsumm 
task.  BUT, understand how this process helped improve solutions to coding problems, and 
think about how we can similarly improve outputs of LLMs for diagnosis task.
